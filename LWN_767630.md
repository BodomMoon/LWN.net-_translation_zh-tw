> It would be reasonable to expect doing nothing to be an easy, simple task for a kernel, but it isn't. At Kernel Recipes 2018, Rafael Wysocki discussed what CPUs do when they don't have anything to do, how the kernel handles this, problems inherent in the current strategy, and how his recent rework of the kernel's idle loop has improved power consumption on systems that aren't doing anything.

一般理論上都會認為對於 kernel 來說不做任何事是非常簡單和單純的，但其實不然。在 Kernel Recipes 2018 上 Rafael Wysocki 就談論到了當 CPU 沒事可做時它會做什麼和 kernel 如何處理這件事。在目前的處理策略上的問題，以及在最近他如何對於 Kernel 的 idle loop 做改動來增進其在閒置時的能源使用效率。

> The idle loop, one of the kernel subsystems that Wysocki maintains, controls what a CPU does when it has no processes to run. Precise to a fault, Wysocki defined his terms: for the purposes of this discussion, a CPU is an entity that can take instructions from memory and execute them at the same time as any other entities in the same system are doing likewise. On a simple, single-core single-processor system, that core is the CPU. If the processor has multiple cores, each of those cores is a CPU. If each of those cores exposes multiple interfaces for simultaneous instruction execution, which Intel calls "hyperthreading", then each of those threads is a CPU. 

idle loop 是由 Wysocki 負責維護的 kernel 子系統之一，負責控制 CPU 在無 processes 要運行時的行為，Wysocki 在本次的討論中精確說明 CPU 是一個實體可以將 instruction 從 memory 取出並且執行，且在同個時間內其他的實體也在執行相同的事情。在一個簡單的單 core 單 processor 系統上，該 core 即為 CPU。如果今天 processor 有多個 core ，則每個 core 都是一個 CPU，如果在每個 core 上都可以拆出不同的 interfaces 去同時運行 instruction，也就是 Intel 所謂的 hyperthreading ，則其上的每個 thread 都是一個 CPU 。

> A CPU is idle if there are no tasks for it to run. Or, again more precisely, the Linux kernel has a number of internal scheduling classes, including the special idle class. If there are no tasks to run on a given CPU in any of those classes save the idle class, the CPU is regarded as idle. If the hardware doesn't make allowance for this, then the CPU will have to run useless instructions until it is needed for real work. However, this is a wildly inefficient use of electricity, so most CPUs support a number of lower-power states into which the kernel can put them until they are needed to do useful work. 

當沒有 task 要執行的時候 CPU 就是閒置的，更精確的說明一下，在 Linux kernel 內其實有許多不同的排程型態，像是特別的閒置型態，如果在特定 CPU 上除了 idle class 之外沒有任何排程有 tasks 要運行，則這個就被認為是閒置的，如果硬體沒有考慮到這點，則 CPU 會不斷執行無用的 instructions 直到真的有工作需要其執行，然而這其實是一種很沒效率的用電方式，所以所以大部分的 CPU 都會支援數種不同的省電模式讓 kernel 可以設置直到真的有工作需要做的時候。

> Idle states are not free to enter or exit. Entry and exit both require some time, and moreover power consumption briefly rises slightly above normal for the current state on entry to idle and above normal for the destination state on exit from idle. Although increasingly deep idle states consume decreasing amounts of power, they have increasingly large costs to enter and exit. This implies that for short idle periods, a fairly shallow idle state is the best use of system resources; for longer idle periods, the costs of a deeper idle state will be justified by the increased power savings while idle. It is therefore in the kernel's best interests to predict how long a CPU will be idle before deciding how deeply to idle it. This is the job of the idle loop. 

進入或離開閒置狀態並非沒有成本的，切入跟切出兩者都會需要一些時間，在進入以及離開 idle 狀態時也會略為增加耗電量，所以其實在切入和切出時都有相當大的成本。這暗示了在較短的 idle 期間，較淺的 idle 狀態會是更好的，而在 idle 越久省下能源相較於的深層 idle 狀態的切換成本才會比較合理，所以 kernel 本身最在意的其實是在預測 CPU 會閒置多久來決定要進入多深的 idle 狀態，這就是 idle loop 的工作。

> In this loop, the CPU scheduler notices that a CPU is idle because it has no work for the CPU to do. The scheduler then calls the governor, which does its best to predict the appropriate idle state to enter. There are currently two governors in the kernel, called "menu" and "ladder". They are used in different cases, but they both try to do roughly the same thing: keep track of system state when a CPU idles and how long it ended up idling for. This is done in order to predict how long a freshly-idle CPU is likely to remain so, and thus what idle state is most appropriate for it. 

在這個迴圈中， CPU scheduler 會注意到 CPU 正在閒置因為目前沒有任何事要做，然後這個 scheduler 就會去呼叫 governor ，他會盡可能的去預測哪種 idle 狀態是適合切入的，在 kernel 中有兩種 governor 分別是 menu 和 ladder ，他們兩個是在不同情況下使用的，但基本上做的事情是一樣的，就是持續追蹤系統的狀態及閒置狀態最後保持了多久，做這些是為了預測接下來的 CPU idle 會保持多久，因此那一種 idle 狀態是最適合的。

> This job is made particularly difficult by the CPU scheduler's clock tick. This is a timer that is run by CPU scheduler for purpose of time-sharing the CPU: if you're going to run multiple jobs on a single CPU, each job can only be run for a while, then periodically put aside in favor of another job. This tick doesn't need to run on a CPU that is idle,since there are no jobs between which the CPU should be shared. Moreover, if the tick is allowed to run on an otherwise-idle CPU, it will prevent the governor from selecting deep idle states by limiting the time for which the CPU is likely to remain idle. So in kernels 4.16 and older,the scheduler disables the tick before calling the governor. When the CPU is woken by an interrupt, the scheduler makes a decision about whether there's work to do and, if so,reactivates the tick.

這像工作的特別困難之處在於 CPU scheduler 的 clock tick ， clock tick 是 CPU scheduler 執行的一個計時器，用於 time-sharing 的處理上，如果今天要在單 CPU 運行多個任務時，個別任務一次只能持續執行一陣子，然後要定期切換到其他的任務。這個計時器在閒置狀態時是不必要的，因為根本沒有任務要執行故不用分享 CPU ，此外如果允許這個計時器執行在 idle 的 CPU 上，他會阻止 governor 去選擇深層的 idle 狀態，因為 CPU 每次能閒置的時間有限。所以在 kernel 4.16 跟更舊的版本上，scheduler 會先禁用 clock tick 再來調用 governor，而當 CPU 被 interrupt 喚醒時，scheduler 會決定是否有任務要做，如果有任務的話再來啟用 clock tick 。

> 註：在發表上有提到為什麼 clock tick 會使 CPU 每次能閒置的時間有限，因為 clock tick 本身是一個切換 CPU 用的計時器，所以每次時間到就會叫醒 CPU ，那閒置就會被瘋狂的打斷。

> If the governor predicts a long idle, and the idle period turns out to be long, the governor "wins": the CPU will enter a deep idle state and power will be saved. But if the governor predicts long idle and the period turns out to be short, the governor "loses" because the costs of entering a deep idle state are not repaid by power savings over the short idle period. Worse, if the governor predicts a short idle period, it loses regardless of the actual idle duration: if the actual duration is long, potential power savings have been missed out on, and if it's short, the costs of stopping and restarting the tick have been paid needlessly. Or to put it another way, because stopping and starting the tick have a cost, there is no point in stopping the tick if the governor is going to predict a short idle. 

如果 governor 預測了一個較長的 idle 且該次的確也 idle 了一段較長的時間，則 governor 的可以說是是「勝利」的，這時 CPU 會進入較深的 idle 狀態而能源也會被省下來。但如果今天governor 預測了一個較長的 idle 狀態但實際上只 idle 了一個很短的週期，則 governor 就「失敗」了，因為進入較深 idle 狀態的消耗並不會被短暫 idle 期間所省下的能源抵銷。還有更遭的是如果 governor 今天預測了一個較短的 idle ，無論實際 idle 的週期為何都會「失敗」，如果實際的 idle 週期為長，會錯失掉正確預測下該有的能源節省，如果實際的 idle 週期為短，則正確預測省下來的能源會被重啟 tick 時額外消耗的能源蓋掉，所以換句話說，因為開關 tick 都有成本，所以在 governor 預測是較短的 idle 時去關掉 tick 是不對的。

> Wysocki considered trying to redesign the governor to work around this, but concluded that the essential problem is that the tick is stopped before the governor is invoked, thus before the recommended idle state is known. He therefore reworked the idle loop for kernel 4.17 so that the decision about stopping the tick is taken after the governor has made its recommendation of the idle state. If the recommendation is for a long idle, the tick is stopped so as not to wake the CPU prematurely. If the recommendation is for a short idle, the tick is left on to avoid paying the cost of turning it off. That means the tick is also a safety net that will wake the CPU in the event that the idle turns out to be longer than predicted and give the governor another chance to get it right. 

Wysocki 認為要試著重新設計 governor 來解決這個問題，但考慮到根本的問題是 tick 在 governor 被調用前就停止了，就在建議的 idle 狀態被告知出來之前。因此他為了 kernel 4.17 重做了一個 idle loop 來讓是否停止 tick 的決定移動到 governor 做出對於 idle 狀態的決議之後。如果該決議是較短的 idle ，則 tick 會被保留下來以避免掉關掉的成本，同時也將 tick 作為一個保險這樣在其實是要 idle 較久時他會去喚醒 CPU 來給 governor 另外一個改成正確的機會

> When the idled CPU is woken by an interrupt, whether from the tick that was left running or by some other event, the scheduler immediately makes a decision about whether there's work to do. If there is, the tick is restarted if need be; but if there is not, the governor is immediately re-invoked. Since that means the governor can now be invoked both when the tick is running and when it is stopped, the governor had to be reworked to take this into account.

不管是來自 tick 或是其他事件，當 idle 中的 CPU 被 interrupt 喚醒時， scheduler 會馬上決定是否真的有事情要做，如果有的話就會視情況看需不需要喚醒 tick。但如果發現其實沒有事的話 governor 就會馬上再被調用一次，這代表 governor 要在不管 tick 有沒有執行時都能被調用，所以 governor 也必須要被重做來把這個功能加入。

> Re-examining the win/loss table from earlier, Wysocki expects things to be improved by this rework. If long idle is predicted, the tick is still stopped, so nothing changes; we win if the actual idle is long, and lose if it's short. But if short idle is predicted, we're better off: if the actual idle is short, we've saved the cost of stopping and restarting the tick, and if the actual idle is long, the unstopped timer will wake us up and give us another bite at the prediction cherry.

重新展示了之前他整理的 win/loss 表格，Wysocki 預期改進之後事情會是這樣：如果較長的 idle 被預測了， tick 依然會停止，沒有任何事情改變，我們在實際的 idle 週期較長時會勝利，反之則輸。但如果是短週期的 idle 被預測了會做得更好，如果實際的 idle 週期也是短的，則我們省下了開關 tick 的成本，如果實際的 idle 週期是較長的，則沒有停下來的 tick timer 會把 CPU 喚醒來給予我們再一次預測正確的機會。

> Since game theory is no substitute for real-world data, Wysocki tested this on a number of systems. The graph above is characteristic of all the systems tested and shows power consumption against time on a system that is idle. The green line is with the old idle loop, the red is with the new: power consumption is less under the new scheme, and moreover it is much more predictable than before. Not all CPUs tested showed as large a gap between the green and red lines, but all showed a flat red line beneath a bumpy green one. As Wysocki put it, this new scheme predicts short idles less often than the old scheme did, but it is right about them being short more often

由於博奕論不能替代真實世界的數據， Wysocki 實際在多個系統上測試過。接下來的圖是在所有系統上測試所展現出來的特性，並顯示出了在 idle 的系統上功耗和時間的相對關係。綠線展示了舊的 idle loop ，紅線則是新的，新規劃下的功耗更少，也更加容易預測。並不是所有的 CPU 測試結果在紅線和綠線上都顯示如此大的差距，但都有著綠線消耗較低也較平緩的共通點。正如 Wysocki 所說，這樣的規劃更少的去預測較短的 idle ，但準確率卻更高。

> In response to a question from the audience, Wysocki said that the work is architecture-independent. Intel CPUs will benefit from it particularly, because they have a comparatively large array of idle states from which the governor may select, giving the governor the best chance of doing well if it predicts correctly; but ARM CPUs, for example, will also benefit.

在回答一個觀眾的問題時，Wysocki 說到這個改善是不依賴於架構的，但 Intel 的 CPU 受益較多，因為他們有一個巨大又複雜的 idle 狀態陣列讓 governor 可以去選，相較於 ARM 的給了 governor 一個更好的機會去做出正確的預測，但兩者其實都有受益。

> A 20% drop in idle power consumption may seem small as victories go, but it's not. Any system that wants to be able to cope reasonably well with peak loads will need spare capacity in normal operation, which will manifest as idle time. The graph above shows CPU usage on my mail/talk/file-transfer/VPN/NTP/etc. server over the past year; the bright yellow is idle time. Saving 20% of that power will please my co-location provider very much indeed, and it's good for the planet, too.

減少 idle 時的 20% 功耗看起來是很小的成果，但其實不然。任何系統都需要能完美的應對峰值的消耗，所以在運行時會需要一些備用的容量，這會在 idle 時顯現出來，這張圖呈現了過去一年伺服器在一些溝通、傳輸、連線.....等行為時的 CPU 使用量，量黃色的部份就是 idle 時，省下這部份的 20％ 能源會非常確實的讓我的合作夥伴很開心，而且這對地球也好。
