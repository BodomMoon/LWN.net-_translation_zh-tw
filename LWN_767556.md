> Coutinuous integration (CI) has becomde increasingly prevalent in open-source projects over the last few years. Intel has been active in building CI system for graphics,both for kernel side and for mesa base user-space side of the equation.Mark Janes and Clayton Craft gave a presentation on Intel's Mesa CI system at the 2018 X.Org Developers Conference (XDC),whic was held in A Coruña,Spain in late September,The Mesa CI system is one of the successful CI initiatives in open source that he knowns of,Janes said.It is a core component of of Mesa development, especially at Intel.

最近幾年中持續整合(以下簡稱 CI) 在開源專案已經變得非常普遍及流行。Intel 也在建構圖像庫的 CI 系統上不管是在 kernel 或是 user space 的工程中都有所行動。 Mark Janes 和 Clayton Craft 在 2018 年九月底於 Coruña,Spain 舉辦的 XDC 中就發表了 Intel 的 Mesa CI 系統，Janes 說 Mesa CI 是一個成功的開源 CI 計畫，更是 Intel 在開發 Mesa 時的核心部份之一。

> 註：避免混淆特別說明一下，「Mesa」是一個 Intel 的圖像庫，而「Mesa CI」則是在開發 Mesa 時使用的 CI 系統

> Like many companies, Intel is a large organization with an "old school development model". He likened it to a Roman army, where there are legions that are made up of smaller groups, each of which has procedures for all of its activities; tents are set up and arranged the same way each time. When Intel first encountered Mesa development, it was something of a shock. There were no architects in the group, but the Mesa developers were simply running right through the Intel army.

就像很多公司一樣，Intel 是一個使用舊時代開發方式的龐大組織。他將其比喻為羅馬軍隊，是一個由各個由不同小型團隊建構成的軍團，每個團隊有其自己做事的方式，卻在搭營時又用統一的方式安排。而當 Intel 第一次遇到 Mesa 的開發團隊時，這其實是一個文化衝擊。因為在這個團隊內雖然沒有架構師，但卻能在 Intel 的整個軍隊中保持流暢的運作。

>There is a tendency to be smug and dismissive of the other parts of the companies that we work in, he said. He thinks it makes more sense to take the time to explain why the open-source methodology is superior. For 50 years, building software has been about differentiation and competing, but part of the open-source model is to collaborate with competitors. He thinks open-source has an unbeatable advantage, but it is still the underdog in many respects; it is "a lot of fun to be an underdog with an advantage", Janes said.

Janes 自認他們團隊的作法是比公司內其他團隊更為優秀的，他認為這值得進一步去闡述為何開源的方式是更加優秀的。他說從過往 50 年以來，建構軟體一直是在差異化和競爭，但開源專案的一部分其實是和競爭對手合作，他覺得開源專案具有無懈可擊的優勢，雖然不能避免的在其他面會有一些缺點的部份，作為一個具有無可擊敗優勢的弱者是很有趣的。

#### Technical details
> He turned things over to Craft, who went over some of the technical details of the CI system. It has roughly 200 machines with full Intel hardware coverage going back to 2007. It runs multiple test suites, including piglit and the conformance test suites (CTS) for Vulkan, OpenGL, and OpenGLES. It does build tests of non-Intel platforms for Android as well. Each commit to the mainline kicks off millions of tests. Users can add their development branches to the CI system, as well, so that commits to those get tested before the code ever ends up in the mainline.

接著 Janes 將主持棒交給了 Craft，後者主要負責 CI 系統中的技術細節，他開始解釋 Mesa CI 有大概 200 台機器，硬體支援程度可回推到 2007 年，並執行多組套件測試，包含 Vulkan,OpenGL,OpenGLES 的一致性測試套件和 piglit，他同時也會在 Android 這種非 Intel 的平台上建置測試，每一個 commit 上到主線時都會啟動上百萬次測試，用戶也可以把他們的開發 branch 加到 CI 系統中，這樣在最終上到主線之前也可以進行測試。

> The target execution time for these tests is 30 minutes or less; otherwise, it doesn't really fit well with a developer's workflow. There is a "very very low false positive rate", Craft said, of about 0.0001%, so developers can be confident that the reports they get are accurate. For various performance tests, it can generate trend lines that make performance regressions easy to spot. The implementation of the CI system is open source and available on GitLab; "steal our stuff", he suggested.

Craft 提到一個測試項目的執行時間大概在 30分鐘以下，不然會跟開發人員的工作流程不符，其誤報率也非常非常低大概僅在0.0001 ％左右，因此開發者可以確信他所得到的報告是正確的。至於在效能上 CI 系統會生成性能測試的趨勢線讓性能的 regressions 可以被很容易的識別。而這套 CI 系統在 GitLab 是開源的，所以他建議各位快去偷吧XD

> 註：這裡的 regressions 是指相關性的分析方式

> Janes said that when the project started, there were no real success stories for testing in open source, nor was there a testing framework available to be used. Being transparent with the results of the testing and the progress of the CI system has helped with its adoption. Having a really low false positive rate, wide coverage, and rapid turnaround has helped as well. He likened working in a project to living with friends as roommates; at first it is great, but eventually the dishes start to pile up and no one wants to deal with them. The CI system is meant to help developers get along; it is the automatic dishwasher for the community, he said.

接著回到 Janes 發表，他說當這個專案剛開始時，在開源測試專案上並沒有成功的先例，也沒有可用的測試框架可以用，所以將這套 CI 系統和他的測試結果保持開源透明有助於推廣使其被採用，同時非常低的誤報率、廣覆蓋率、快速的週期也有所幫助，接著他把在同一個專案內工作比喻為和朋友同住，在一開始一切都很順利，但最終需要洗的髒盤子開始堆積無人有意願處理。而 CI 系統的用意就在幫助開發者們保持和諧相處，所以他就是一個社群的自動洗碗機。

> 註：Janes 本來後續在[該文章](https://lwn.net/Articles/767556/)下方留言有道歉提到，他當時表達的意思有偏差，"there were no real success stories for testing in open source" 是不太對的，他想表達的意思是 "There were some efforts to automate graphics testing before 2014, but they were not open source" 的意思。

#### Stats and graphs

> Statistics are useful, but they can also be misused. Some stats are easy to collect and highly visible, but do not necessarily correlate to the measures that get imparted to them. For example, tracking and prominently showing the number of commits in a particular area can lead to more white-space commits or to splitting commits with an eye toward boosting those numbers, he said.

統計數據是很有用的，但同時也有可能被誤用，有一些統計數據特別顯而易見並容易被收集，但不一定跟紀錄下他們的措施有所相關，他舉個例子，如果只在意單就一個特定區塊的 commit 數量可能會導致更多意義不明的 white-space commit 以及 splitting commits。

> 註：這裡我是看了他發表時的影片去意譯的，在我看來他想表達的是不能用 commit 當工程師是否努力的判斷，否則大家就會開始無謂的增加 commit 數量。可參考[該影片](https://youtu.be/nm3U7jaNJQQ?t=696)

> That said, he started showing graphs from their slides [PDF](https://xdc2018.x.org/slides/Mesa_Continuous_Integration_at_Intel.pdf). He started with a graph that showed both the number of commits and the number of CI builds for each developer with more than 30 commits since the CI system started in August 2014. One thing it shows is that an active developer can also be an active user of the CI system—several of the most active developers have nearly as many CI builds as commits. Some other developers are perhaps trying to be extra safe and do more CI builds than commits, or maybe they are simply new to Mesa and are learning. In general, for those using the CI system, the number of builds was roughly on the same level as the number of commits.

接著他秀出了一個上面有從 August 2014 開始所有提交超過 30 次 commit 的開發者的圖，圖上闡述了一件事就是一個活躍的開發者同時也會是 CI 系統的重度使用者，而其中幾個最活躍的開發者在 CI 上提交和建構的次數幾乎是一樣多的，當然也有一些可能特別注重安全的開發者會建構數量大於提交數量，但其實也有可能這只是一個新手在練習，所以通常一個 CI 系統的使用者他們建構跟提交的數量會是一樣的，(你不能單看提交或是建構的其一的數量去評斷一件事)。

> 註：括號內的補充是這是他在影片中舉例但文章沒提到的論點。

> Janes then described two ways to track bugs that get introduced into Mesa: reverts and fixes. Reverts are as old as Git, but fixes are relatively new. The "Fixes" tag was introduced in 2017; it notes the commit ID that is being fixed. In both cases, the "offending" commit ID can be extracted, thus the developer who introduced the bug can be identified. The Fixes tag is used to help automate the inclusion of commits into bug-fix releases.

Janes 接著敘述了兩種被引入 Mesa 的追蹤 bug 方式有 reverts 和 fixes，其中 Reverts 跟 git 的舊有版本是一樣的，但 fixes 就是一種相對較新的作法，Fixes 的標記是在 2017 年被引入的，他會把被修復的 commit ID 記錄下來，在兩種方式中提交錯誤程式的該筆 commit ID 都可以被提取出來，所以開發者可以知道 bug 是誰生出來的，而 fixes tag 用於將該筆的 commit ID 自動加進修完 bug 之後的版本。

> For the following graphs, he removed the names of the developers, and just identified them by the number of commits they made over the period that the graph covered. He showed a graph of the percentage of fixes per commit as well as the number of CI builds since the Fixes tag was adopted in 2017. As might be guessed, those who are heavy users of CI tend to have much lower rates of patches needing Fixes. He joked that since the names were not on the graph, he would be happy to accept beer from any developer who wanted to ensure that no one would ever know which entry on the graph was theirs.

而在後續的圖片中，他將開發者的名子移除了，只留下了他們在圖表包含的時間段內做的提交數量作為標示，並展示了一張上有被標上 fixes tag / commit 總數比例的以及 CI 建構數量從 2017 採用 fixes tag 之後的統計圖，正如預期的 CI 的使用者有更低的比例在 patche 中被標上 Fixes，他開玩笑說他很樂意接受任何想確保自己在圖上之真正排名不會被任何人知道的開發者請他一杯啤酒。

Looking at CI builds and reverts back to the start of the CI era in 2014 shows a similar correlation to the Fixes graph, though the signal is somewhat noisier. But heavier users of the CI system tend to have fewer reverts, in general.

就算回到 2014 年去看 CI 在剛開始時 build 和 reverts 的數量也顯示跟 Fixes tags 在前一張圖展現出的相關性，雖然相對的訊息比較雜亂一點，但大致上 CI 的重度使用者也傾向於更少的 reverts。

> There is quite a bit of work that goes into ensuring that the CI test results are useful and do not contain known failure cases, Craft said. There are lots of tests that will never run on certain platforms, so those need to be filtered out of the test results. That way, spurious failures will not clutter inboxes or the CI status web site.
>
> In addition, once a bug has been identified stemming from a particular commit, and the developer has been notified, it does not help other developers to get notified of that problem. Craft said that he and Janes identify these commits and configure the CI system to expect the failing test(s).


接著 Craft 說其中還是有一些額外的工作要做，以確認 CI 測試結果是有效的且不會包含已知的失敗案例，有很多的測試並不會在特定平台上執行，所以這部份必須要被從測試結果中過濾出來，這樣誤報才不會弄亂收件箱或是 報告 CI 狀態的網站。

此外，每當一個 bug 已經被標明出來自於那一個特定提交，並且該開發者也被通知過了之後，這個 bug 就不會再通知其他的開發者，Craft 說他跟 Janes 就負責標明這些提交和確認 CI 系統後續會排除這些已預期失敗的測試。

> At that point, though, when someone fixes the problem, the test will start passing, which could seem like a failure to the CI system. Switching back to the pre-bug CI configuration will fix that problem. But a development branch that was made before the fix will not pass the test. It can't use the post-fix configuration. So the CI configuration files are tracked in Git and the changes to the test results are tagged with commit IDs. That way branches will only have failures caused by changes on the branch and the mainline will reflect known bugs and fixes properly.
>
> Those configuration files can be used to gather some statistics about test regressions, Janes said. For the i965 driver, commits that regressed the tests were generally fewer for those who used the CI system more. He summed up his case by saying that CI is helpful for developers, those who use it love it because they don't like having their commits reverted and the CI system allows them to avoid that. At Intel, it is believed that use of CI has a multiplicative effect on the rate of development, he said.

而當某個人修正該問題的當下開始測試後，測試結果開始傳遞，結果對 CI 系統來說他會預期這次應該要失敗，切換回之前有 bug 的 CI 配置檔可以解決這個問題，但開發者那邊可能會有分支是在 fix 被丟到測試之前創建的，那他就不能使用使用修復後的配置檔，所以 CI 的配置檔會一路跑到 git 去檢查並在改變測試結果時標上該筆提交的 ID，這樣該分支的測試失敗就只會在改變分之時出現，而主線也會正確的知道 bugs 和 fixes 。

Janes 提到這些配置檔也可以用來收集一些有關 test regressions 的統計資料，對於 i965 的驅動來說，CI 使用者使測試結果退步的提交的比例是相對較低的。他總結在他所見的案例中 CI 對於開發者是非常有幫助的，使用者愛用是因為他們並不想他們的 commit 被 revert 而 CI 讓他們可以避免這點。Intel 相信使用 CI 對於開發效率能有倍率的成長

> CI hardware
There are around 200 computers in the CI system, Craft said. On average, they are about $400 systems but, in reality, most of the money goes for the high-end, new systems. The project got the older systems for free or for pennies on the dollar from eBay.
>
> There are servers, desktops, and laptops represented, though the builds for those systems are done on dedicated Xeon systems. Craft showed some pictures of the CI hardware, which consists of "a lot of systems in a small amount of space". Various tricks have been used to squeeze more into that space, including an innovative use of Ikea napkin holders to store laptops vertically.
>
> As part of the talk, Intel is announcing a new, public CI results site. Previously,those outside of Intel would get an email with the results of their CI run that they would need to parse to figure out what went wrong. Those inside of Intel could use the Jenkins web site, but it took a long time for pages to appear. The old site would take nearly a minute and a half, while the new site is just over half a second.

Craftd 說在 CI 系統上有大概兩百台電腦，一般來說他們每個會是大約美金四百元的系統，但實際上大部分的錢都用在高端的新系統，這個專案舊的系統大部份是免費或是很便宜從 eBay 買來的。

這些 servers, desktops, and laptops 就是 CI 的硬體部份，不過建置是在專用的 Xeon 系統上完成的，Craft 展示了一些 CI 硬體的圖片，由此展現了"大部分的系統是在非常小的空間中"，它們被使用於擠在一起的小空間中，包括一種用 Ikea 的餐巾夾垂直的存放一台筆電的創新作法。

在談話中的一部分中， Intel 也宣佈了新的 CI 結果公佈網站，在以前的作法中，Intel 之外的人會收到一封包含 CI 運行結果的 email 讓他們找出哪裡有問題，而內部的人則是使用 Jenkins 的網站，但舊的網站會花上將近一分半鐘，而新的網站只要半秒鐘就可以。

> Janes and Craft took a test drive through the new site, which provides lots of information about what builds were tested and what the outcome was. If tests failed, one can drill down to see the test output, history, and more. Piglit did not build earlier on the day of the talk, but because of the CI system, it was noticed and fixed before many developers even knew it was broken, Janes said.
>
> In the Q&A, Janes suggested that those who want to have their own tests run get them added to piglit or another of the community test suites. He also said that it is difficult to identify a small subset of tests that give a good indication of driver Health in, say, one minute. He noted that all of the work on the new CI web site was mostly done to support those outside of Intel; other than speeding up web site loading time, it didn't really provide anything new to Intel Developers. Janes and Craft clearly hope that more Mesa developers will use the system and that all of Mesa development will benefit.

隨後他們兩人一起展示並且試用了新的網站，網站內展示了非常多有關建置、測試及結果為何。如果測試失敗了也可以深入研究測試的輸出、歷史紀錄及其他更多訊息，像 Piglit 在當天發表前其實沒有建置成功，但由於 CI 系統，這個問題的發現以及修復在很多開發者意識到這東西壞了之前就完成了。

在 Q&A 中，Janes 建議那些也想要有自己的測試結果的人把測試加到 piglit 或是其他社群的測試套件中，他也提到很難在一分鐘內緊靠一部分的測試去給出一個 driver 的良好與否，他指出在新的 Mesa CI 網站上的努力主要是希望能支援 Intel 以外的人，不只是提昇網站的載入速度而已，他實際上並沒有提供任何新的東西給 Intel 的開發者，他們兩人顯然希望能讓更多的 Mesa 開發者去使用這套系統讓所有 Mesa 的開發者能共同受惠。
